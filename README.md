# Saugat Shrestha - Computer Science Portfolio

As a high school senior looking to go into computer science in university without having a lot of prior experience, I had to focus on productivity and completing meaningful work to make the most of my time. Completing meaningful work means working to learn rather than for completion. This portfolio is assembled to display my progress in getting familiar with the world of coding, by showing what I have learned.

## Top 10 modules

### Intro to JS: Drawing & Animation
This was the first module I worked through on Khan Academy and JavaScript was a completely new coding language for me when I started this module. I was already a little familiar with basic coding, but it was my first time working with a canvas. Learning how to use processing.js and engage in various projects had a positive impact on my overall learning process because it was a forgiving but encouraging work environment on Khan Academy.

### Intro to HTMLL/CSS: Making Webpages
This module was also an introduction to a coding language I had never used before. Something specific to have a big impact on me was that I was able to realize and better appreciate just how useful references can be for when the syntax or many tag names are overwhelming.
Although web development is one of my less favourite aspects of computer science, I do recognize its importance. In the future, I would like to hone my CSS skills and try to feed my creativity more.

### Advanced JS: Games and Visualizations 

### Advanced JS: Natural Simulations

### Creative Coding Session 

### AP:CS - Digital Information, Algorithms

### AP:CS - Computer Innovations, The Internet

### AP:CS - Programming
Many of the concepts in this module were things I had already learned in C++. Revisiting some of these basic coding concepts using a different language was a healthy experience because it was not difficult but I was still gaining useful knowledge on JavaScript.
Programming is something that I will surely try to keep improving on and fortunately, there are many aspects of programming I still need to improve. For example, I would like to get more comfortable with object oriented programming using multiple classes.

### AP:CS - Data Analysis, Data Security, Simulations

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/saugatttt/ComSciPortfolio/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
